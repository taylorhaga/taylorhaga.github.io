      <h1>Hi there!</h1>  
      <h2>Let me introduce myself...</h2>
       <p>My name is Taylor and I am majoring in Graphic Design. I currently live with my fiance in North Mankato. 
           In our free time, we usually like spending time with our dogs, going to different breweries and 
           walking different trails. We have two dogs and two cats. 
        <p style="font-style: italic ;">Fun fact: our cats are bigger than our dogs.... </p>
       <div style="background-color: peru;">
       <h2 style="font-weight: bold;>Can anyone guess what kind of dogs we have? </h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Chihuahua</li>
        <li>Yorkshire Terrier</li>
        <li>Pug</li>
